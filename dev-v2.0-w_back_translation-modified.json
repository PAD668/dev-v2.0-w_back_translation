As for double expansion engines, if the space is higher, two smaller cylinders may be used for low pressure. In many expansion engines the cylinders were usually arranged on the line, but there were several other formations in use. At the end of the 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing system was used in some marine triple expansion engines. Y-S-T engines divided the low pressure expansion steps between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This made the crankshaft more balanced, leading to a smoother and faster reacting engine that was less vibrational.

In practice, steam turbines replaced the shock engines of electric power plants in the early 1900s, when their efficiency, greater speed and smooth rotation for the maintenance of the generator were the advantage.

The high pressure vapour from the boiler in the combined engine expands in the high pressure cylinder (HP) and then moves to one or more subsequent low pressure cylinders (LP). The complete expansion of the steam now takes place through several cylinders, and now that there is less expansion in each cylinder, the steam loses less heat. This reduces the heating and cooling capacity of cylinders, which increases engine power. When the extension is placed in several cylinders, the variation of torque can be reduced.

In 1905 HMS Dreamnought was the first major warship to replace the impact motor with a proven technology with the then new steam turbine.[A quote is needed]"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What do nuclear power plants heat to create electricity?", "id": "571166352419e314009555f1", "answers": [{"text": "water", "answer_start": 63}, {"text": "water", "answer_start": 63}, {"text": "water", "answer_start": 63}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where were non-condensing direct-drive locomotives notably used for fast passenger trains?", "id": "571166352419e314009555f5", "answers": [{"text": "Britain", "answer_start": 606}, {"text": "Britain", "answer_start": 606}, {"text": "Britain", "answer_start": 606}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "water", "answer_start": 63}], "question": "What do nuclear power plants heat to create steam turbines?", "id": "5ad3fabc604f3c001a3ffb1b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "turbine", "answer_start": 104}], "question": "What does the steam generated by a auxiliary power drive?", "id": "5ad3fabc604f3c001a3ffb1c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Britain", "answer_start": 606}], "question": "Where were non-condensing direct-drive locomotives notably used for fast passenger ships?", "id": "5ad3fabc604f3c001a3ffb1f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Almost all nuclear power plants produce electricity by heating water to provide steam that controls the turbine connected to the electric generator.

Steam turbine locomotives were manufactured in limited quantities. Some locomotives without condensing direct locomotives were able to do some long-distance freight traffic in Sweden and the work of express passengers in Britain, but they were not repeated. Elsewhere, especially in the United States, more sophisticated models with electricity transmission were constructed experimentally, but were not repeated.

The main difference is that the heat increase (in the boiler) and rejection (in the radiator) are the isobaric (continuous pressure) processes of the Rankine cycle and the isoteral (continuous temperature) processes of the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle, the pump is used to pressurise the liquid from the radiator into a non-gas liquid. Pumping the work fluid in liquid form over the cycle requires a small part of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the gaseous-fuelled fluid in the compressor (such as the Carnot cycle).

Oxygen gas is the second most common component of the earth\u2019s atmosphere, with a capacity of 20.8% and a mass of 23.1% (approximately 1015 tonnes).[d] On the planets of the solar system on earth, it is unusual for its atmosphere to have such high levels of oxygen gas: Mars (volume 0.1 percent of O2) and Venus concentrations are much lower. The O2 around these other planets is produced solely by ultraviolet radiation on oxygen-containing molecules such as carbon dioxide."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What scientist told the French Academy of Sciences that he had found how to liquefy oxygen?", "id": "571caac55efbb31900334dc8", "answers": [{"text": "Raoul Pierre Pictet", "answer_start": 182}, {"text": "Raoul Pierre Pictet", "answer_start": 182}, {"text": "Pierre Pictet", "answer_start": 188}, {"text": "Pictet", "answer_start": 195}, {"text": "Raoul Pierre Pictet", "answer_start": 182}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "On what date was oxygen liquefied in a stable form?", "id": "571caac55efbb31900334dca", "answers": [{"text": "March 29, 1883", "answer_start": 824}, {"text": "March 29, 1883", "answer_start": 824}, {"text": "March 29, 1883", "answer_start": 824}, {"text": "March 29, 1883", "answer_start": 824}, {"text": "March 29, 1883", "answer_start": 824}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "chemist and physicist", "answer_start": 160}], "question": "What were Pierre Raoul Pictet's professions?", "id": "5ad23eefd7d075001a4288d8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "telegram", "answer_start": 380}], "question": "What was sent on December 29, 1877?", "id": "5ad23eefd7d075001a4288d9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Oxygen", "answer_start": 794}], "question": "What was liquified in a stable state for the first time on March 22, 1883?", "id": "5ad23eefd7d075001a4288da", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "At the end of the 19th century, scientists understood that the air can be liquefied and its parts isolated by pressing and cooling it.

The TEU will enable the European Council to issue specific provisions for regions such as Gibraltar and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon in customs matters. The TEU excludes certain regions, such as the Faroe Islands, from the jurisdiction of European Union law. The Treaties shall apply as soon as they enter into force, unless otherwise specified, and shall normally be concluded for an unlimited period. The TEU provides that commitments entered into between Member States prior to the signature of the Agreement are no longer valid. In accordance with the TEU, all EU Member States are considered to be the general obligation of the principle of cooperation to refrain from taking measures which could jeopardise the achievement of the objectives of the TEU. The Court of Justice of the European Union may interpret the Treaties but cannot decide on their validity under international law.

This has led both the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the highest national courts to develop principles for resolving conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the Union, the Court of Justice considers that where EU law is incompatible with national law, EU law is a priority. In the first significant case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and Costa, a former shareholder of the energy company, refused to pay their electricity bill to Enel as a protest against the nationalisation of Italian energy companies. He claimed that the Italian nationalisation law was incompatible with the Treaty of Rome and requested that it be referred to both the Italian Constitutional Court and Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Italian Constitutional Court held that, since the Law on Nationalisation was from 1962 and the Convention was in force from 1958, Costa had no requirements. Instead, the Court held that, ultimately, the Treaty of Rome did not in any way prevent the nationalisation of energy and, in any event, according to the provisions of the Treaty, only the Commission could have made a claim, not Costa. However, Costa was in principle entitled to plead that the agreement was incompatible with national law and the Court should take into account his claim to lodge an appeal if its decision is not contested. The Court reiterated its view at Van Gend en Loos and stated that the Member States 'although in limited areas they have limited their sovereign rights and created a set of laws applicable both to their citizens and to themselves' on the basis of reciprocity.

In accordance with the principle of primacy of Community law, the Court stated that 'the measures directly applicable to the institutions (such as the relevant regulations) 'do not automatically apply the provisions of existing national law'. This was necessary in order to prevent Member States from \"refusaling unconditionally and irrevocably\" the obligations of the Treaty which could \"infringe\" the foundations of the EU.

The postal company Van Gend en Loos claimed that the current Article 30 TFEU prevented the Dutch customs authorities from levying tariffs when importing urea formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After referring to the case by the Dutch court, the Court held that, although the Treaties did not 'clearly' give citizens or undertakings the right to make claims, they could do so. Historically, international agreements had only allowed States to have legal requirements for their implementation, but the Court declared that 'the Community is a new legal order of international law'. Since Article 30 clearly states, unconditionally and immediately, that no quantitative restriction can be imposed on trade without good grounds, Van Gend en Loos can recover the money he has paid. In this respect, EU regulations are the same as the Treaty provisions, since, as stated in Article 288 TFEU, they are directly applicable in all Member States. Moreover, Member States are obliged not to repeat regulations in their own legislation in order to avoid confusion. In the Commission v Italy, for example, the Court held that Italy had infringed the obligation under the Treaties because it had not implemented a system whereby farmers were paid a premium for slaughtering cows (in order to reduce the overproduction of dairy cattle) and because the rules had been repeated by a regulation by means of various additions. \"The Regulations shall enter into force only for the purpose of their publication\" and their implementation may jeopardise their simultaneous and uniform application throughout the Union.\" On the other hand, some regulations may require specific implementing measures, in which case these specific rules should be complied with."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What generally does not allow citizens to sue other citizens?", "id": "57269cc3dd62a815002e8b12", "answers": [{"text": "Directives", "answer_start": 915}, {"text": "Directives", "answer_start": 915}, {"text": "Directives", "answer_start": 915}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many paid holiday days do most member states require?", "id": "57269cc3dd62a815002e8b14", "answers": [{"text": "28 days", "answer_start": 704}, {"text": "more than 28 days", "answer_start": 694}, {"text": "more than 28 days", "answer_start": 694}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Directives", "answer_start": 915}], "question": "What generally does allow citizens to sue other citizens?", "id": "5ad140ab645df0001a2d13ca", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Working Time Directive", "answer_start": 567}], "question": "What does not require more than 28 days in national law?", "id": "5ad140ab645df0001a2d13cd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Although the Treaties and regulations have a direct impact (if clear, unconditional and immediate), directives generally do not give citizens (as opposed to a Member State) the right to sue other citizens.

This partly reflects the fact that directives often create minimum standards, allowing Member States to apply stricter standards. For example, the Working Time Directive requires each worker to have at least four weeks of paid leave per year, but most Member States require more than 28 days of national legislation. However, the current position of the Court of Justice allows citizens to make demands based on national legislation implementing directives but not on the directives themselves. Directives do not have a direct effect (i.e. \"horizontal\" effect) (i.e. between non-governmental parties).

Pubblico Ministero v Ratti, because the Italian Government had not implemented Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and packaging solvents by the deadline, it no longer implemented the 1963 illegal national law against Ratt\u2019s solvent and varnish business. A Member State cannot 'apply to individuals in the manner in which it has failed to fulfil its obligations under the Directive'. Secondly, a citizen or an undertaking may rely on the Directive, not only in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. Accordingly, in its judgment in CIA Security v. Signalson and Securitel, the Court held that a company called CIA Security could defend itself against competitors\u2019 claims that it had failed to comply with the Belgian regulation on alert systems since 1991 because it had not been notified to the Commission as required by the Directive. Thirdly, if the directive reflects the 'general principle' of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-governmental parties before the deadline for its implementation. This is the result of the judgment of K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci v Swedennx GmbH & Co KG, in which Article 622 of the German Civil Code states that the working years of persons under the age of 25 are not counted against the increasing legal dismissal before dismissal. K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci worked for Swedennx GmbH & Co KG for 10 years at the age of 18-28 before his dismissal. He claimed that a law that is not counted under 25 is illegal age discrimination under the framework directive on equal opportunities in working life. The Court considered that he could rely on the Directive because equality is also a general principle of EU law. Thirdly, if the defendant is a State ambassador, even if it is not a central government, it can still be bound by directives. In Foster v British Gas plc, the Court held that Foster was entitled to bring an action for discrimination on grounds of sex against his employer British Gas plc, who retired women at the age of 60 and men at the age of 65 if 1) under a State measure, 2) Foster provided a public service and 3) had special powers.

The Court quickly acknowledged that the obligation to interpret could not conflict with the clear words of the national statute. Fifthly, if a Member State has not implemented the directive, the citizen may not necessarily bring an action against non-state parties but may bring an action against the Member State itself for failure to implement the law. The Italian Government had therefore not set up an insurance fund against Italy in Francovich, which would require unpaid wages from employees if their employers had been insolvent, as required by the Insolvency Protection Directive. As a result, Francovich, a former employee of a company in Venetian bankruptcy, was able to claim from the Italian Government ITL 6 million in compensation for its loss.

According to the standard theory of the comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less profitable economy in all respects. Like other regional organisations, such as the North American Free Trade Association or the World Trade Organisation, the dismantling of trade barriers and the free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, consumer prices are to be reduced. It was originally a theory that the free trade area tends to give way to a customs union which led to a common market, then to monetary union, then to a monetary and fiscal union, a political union, and ultimately to a full federation typical of a federal state. In Europe, however, these stages were very confusing and it is not clear whether the 'end game' should be the same as a country that has traditionally been understood. In practice, free trade without standards in order to ensure fair trade may benefit some people and groups in countries (particularly large companies) far more than others, but it puts a strain on people who do not have bargaining power in growing markets, particularly workers, consumers, small businesses, emerging industries and communities. Articles 28 to 37 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union establish the principle of the free movement of goods within the EU, while Articles 45 to 66 require the free movement of persons, services and capital. These so-called four freedoms were thought to prevent physical barriers (e.g. customs), technical barriers (e.g. different laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and tax obstacles (e.g. different VAT rates). The tension of the law is that free movement and trade are not intended to flow into a licence that justifies unlimited commercial profit. The Treaties restrict free trade and give priority to other values, such as public health, consumer protection, workers' rights, fair competition and the improvement of the environment. The Court of Justice has increasingly held that the general objectives of the Treaty in support of the specific objectives of free trade are to improve people's well-being."}, {"qas": [{"plausible_answers": [{"text": "duties", "answer_start": 183}], "question": "What is not prohibited between member states?", "id": "5ad15289645df0001a2d175b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "imports", "answer_start": 145}], "question": "What the the EU not manage from non-member states?", "id": "5ad15289645df0001a2d175c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Commission v France", "answer_start": 1341}], "question": "What case were French vigilantes helping shipments of Spanish Strawberries?", "id": "5ad15289645df0001a2d175e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved through a customs union and the principle of non-discrimination. The EU manages imports from third countries, customs duties between Member States are prohibited and imports move freely. Furthermore, Article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that \"quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States\". In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville, the Court held that that rule meant all the \"commercial rules\" which \"Member States have complied with\" and which could prevent trade \"directly or indirectly, effectively or possibly\" by Article 34. This meant that the Belgian law, according to which the import of Scotch whisky must be accompanied by a certificate of origin, is unlikely to be lawful. It discriminates against parallel importers, such as Dassonville, who could not obtain certificates from the French authorities from which they bought whiskey. This 'wide-scale test' to determine what could be an illegal restriction of trade also applies equally to the activities of pseudo-government bodies such as the former 'buy Irish' company which have employees appointed by the government. It also means that countries can be responsible for private operators. For example, the Commission v France, French farmers, are constantly sabotaging Spanish strawberries and even Belgian tomato imports. France was responsible for these barriers to trade because the authorities 'obviously and persistently refrained' from preventing sabotage. In general, where a Member State has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports in accordance with Article 35 TFEU) it shall be justified on the basis of Article 36. The reasons are public morality, policy or safety, 'protection of human, animal or plant health and life', 'artificial, historical or archaeological value' and 'industrial and commercial property'. Moreover, even if environmental protection is not explicitly mentioned, it may justify trade restrictions on the mandatory requirement resulting from Article 11 TFEU. Generally speaking, it has increasingly been recognised that fundamental human rights must take precedence over all trade rules. In its judgment in Schmidberger v Austria, the Court therefore held that Austria did not infringe Article 34 because it did not prohibit a protest which prevented heavy goods transport over A13, Brenner Autobahn, on its way to Italy. Although many companies, including Schmidberger\u2019s German company, were prevented from trading, the Court concluded that freedom of association was a fundamental pillar of a democratic society against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced and likely to be subjected. Where a Member State invokes Article 36, its measures shall be proportionately applied. This means that the rule must have a legitimate objective and (1) be suitable for achieving the objective; (2) it must be necessary to prevent a less restrictive measure from achieving the same result and (3) it must be reasonable to balance the advantages of free trade within the meaning of Article 36."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which country did Rewe-Zentrale AG wish to import from?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e9", "answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 927}, {"text": "France", "answer_start": 927}, {"text": "France", "answer_start": 927}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ea", "answers": [{"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1783}, {"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1783}, {"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1783}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "All Italian chocolate is made from what alone?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8eb", "answers": [{"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2006}, {"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2006}, {"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2006}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 927}], "question": "Which country dod Rewe-Zentrale AG not wish to import from?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1797", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Often the rules apply neutrally to all products, but they may have a greater practical impact on imports than domestic products. For such a 'indirect' discriminatory (or 'clearly applicable' act, the Court has developed more arguments: either for requirements under Article 36 or for supplementary 'compulsory' or 'overriding' requirements, such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, diversity of the press, fairness in trade, and more: classes are not closed. In the most famous case, Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Brantwein, the Court ruled that the German law requiring all alcoholic beverages and liqueurs (not only imported) to have an alcoholic strength of at least 25 % is contrary to Article 34 of the TFEU because it has a greater negative impact on imports. German liqueurs were more than 25 % alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wanted to import from France, was only 15-20 % alcohol. The Court rejected the arguments of the German Government that the measure would be proportionate to protect public health under Article 36 TFEU, since stronger drinks were available and sufficient labelling would be sufficient for consumers to understand what they were buying. This rule applies primarily to the requirements relating to the content or packaging of the product. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA, the Court ruled that the Belgian law requiring all margarines to be in cubic packages infringed Article 34 and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians believe that it is butter if it is not shaped into cubes was disproportionate: it would 'extremely exceed the requirements of the subject' and labelling would protect consumers 'as effectively'. In 2003, the Commission v Italy required Italian legislation that cocoa products containing other vegetable fats should not be labelled as \u2018success products\u2019. It must have been \"chocolate.\" All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter only, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed that the law violated Article 34. The Court held that the low level of vegetable fat does not justify chocolate substitute labelling. This was demeaning in the eyes of consumers. \"A neutral and objective statement was enough to protect consumers. Where Member States impose significant barriers to the use of a product, they may also infringe Article 34. In its 2009 case, the Court of Justice held, in the Commission v Italy, that the Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds from towing trailers infringed Article 34. The law was again applied impartially to everyone, but it had a disproportionate impact on importers because Italian companies did not produce trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court concluded that a ban would prevent people from buying it: it would have 'a significant impact on consumer behaviour', which would 'have an impact on the market access of the product concerned'. It would require justification under Article 36 or as a mandatory requirement."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which two importers claimed that under a French competition law, they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf59", "answers": [{"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 256}, {"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 256}, {"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 256}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In which case did the Court of Justice review Swedish bans on advertising to young children under 12?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5b", "answers": [{"text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "answer_start": 1006}, {"text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "answer_start": 1006}, {"text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "answer_start": 1006}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Under which Directive did the EU harmonize restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5c", "answers": [{"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1895}, {"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1895}, {"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1895}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 256}], "question": "Which two importers did not claim that under French competition law, they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17da", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "answer_start": 1006}], "question": "Which case did the Court of Justice not review Swedish bans on advertising to young children und er 12?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17dd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Unlike product requirements or other laws prohibiting access to the market, the Court developed the presumption that \"sales arrangements\" should not fall within Article 34 TFEU if they are applied equally to all sellers and affect them in the same way.

The Court held that 'under the law and in fact' it was an equally appropriate'sales arrangement' (not an arrangement which alters the content of a product) which was not covered by Article 34 and therefore did not have to be justified. Sales arrangements can be considered to have an unequal effect in the case of 'in fact', particularly when traders in another Member State attempt to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In the case of Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini, the Court examined the Swedish prohibitions on advertising to children under 12 years of age and misleading advertisements on skin care products. Although the prohibitions have remained (as a legitimate or mandatory requirement under Article 36), the Court stressed that full marketing bans may be disproportionate if advertising is \"the only effective form of promotion enabling [the trader] to enter the market\". In the case of Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB, the Court ruled that the advertising of alcohol on radio, television and magazines could be prohibited in full in Article 34, where advertising was the only way for sellers to gain the \"traditional social practices and local customs and customs\" of consumers, but the national courts again decide whether it is justified under Article 36 in order to protect public health. According to the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU has harmonised restrictions on marketing and advertising in order to prohibit behaviour which distorts the behaviour of average consumers is misleading or aggressive and to list examples that are considered unfair. States increasingly need to mutually recognise each other's regulatory standards, while the EU has sought to harmonise the minimum ideals of best practice. It is hoped that standards will be raised in order to avoid \"beginning at the bottom\" of regulation and to allow consumers to obtain products from across the continent."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which entity focused upon the free movement of workers?", "id": "5726baf2dd62a815002e8e75", "answers": [{"text": "the European Community", "answer_start": 180}, {"text": "the European Community", "answer_start": 180}, {"text": "the European Community", "answer_start": 180}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Since its foundation, the Treaties have sought to enable people to achieve their goals of life in any country by means of free movement. Due to the economic nature of the project, the European Community initially focused on the free movement of workers as a \"production factor\". Since the 1970s, however, the focus has shifted to the development of a more \"social\" Europe. Freedom of movement was increasingly based on 'citizenship', so people had the right to give them the opportunity to become economically and socially active instead of being a prerequisite for economic activity. This means that the fundamental rights of the \"worker\" of Article 45 TFEU are a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in Articles 18 to 21 TFEU. According to the Court of Justice, 'worker' is anyone who is economically active, including all those who are employed, under the guidance of another person, 'for compensation'. However, you do not have to pay for work in cash if you are protected as an employee. For example, in Steymann v Staatsexpertaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right of residence in the Netherlands when he volunteered for the plumbing and domestic work of the Bhagwan Community, which provided for the material needs of all, regardless of their contribution. The Court held that Mr Steymann had the right to remain, provided that at least an 'indirect countermeasure' was obtained for the work he had done. The status of \"employer\" means protection against all forms of discrimination by the government and employers in access to employment, taxation and social security rights. On the other hand, a citizen who is \"all citizens of a Member State\" (Article 20(1) TFEU) has the right to seek employment, to vote in municipal elections and in elections to the European Parliament, but a more limited right to claim social security. In practice, freedom of movement has become politically controversial when nationalistic political parties have manipulated fears that immigrants are taking people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time). Nevertheless, in practice \"all available studies show that labour mobility has little impact on the salaries and employment of local workers\"."}, {"qas": [{"question": "In the case Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, how many hours was the Dutch woman in question working in Germany?", "id": "5726bc1add62a815002e8eaa", "answers": [{"text": "between 3 and 14 hours a week", "answer_start": 2872}, {"text": "3 and 14 hours a week", "answer_start": 2880}, {"text": "between 3 and 14 hours a week", "answer_start": 2872}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Jean-Marc Bosman", "answer_start": 381}], "question": "Which Belgian footballer claimed that he should not be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Liege to USL Dunkerque?", "id": "5ad157cf645df0001a2d1816", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "equal treatment", "answer_start": 79}], "question": "What did most people not require regarding social advantages?", "id": "5ad157cf645df0001a2d1817", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Articles 1 to 7 on the free movement of workers set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers. Firstly, Articles 1 to 4 generally require workers to be able to enter into employment, to enter into contracts and not to be discriminated against against against nationals of a Member State. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v. Bosman, Belgian footballer Jean-Marc Bosman, argued that he should be able to move from R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque at the end of the contract, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the normal transfer fees. The Court held that 'transfer rules constitute an obstacle to free movement' and that they are unlawful unless they can be justified in the public interest, but this is unlikely. In Groener v Minister of Education, the Court accepted that the requirement to teach Gaelics at the Dublin Model School could be justified as part of a general practice promoting Irish but only if the measure is not disproportionate. On the other hand, Angonese v. Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA, the Italian bank in Bolzano, was not allowed to claim from Angones a bilingual certificate available only from Bolzano. With its \"horizontal\" direct effect on Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court justified that people from other countries would have little chance of obtaining a certificate and that \"it is impossible to provide evidence of the required language skills in any other way\", the measure was disproportionate. Secondly, Article 7(2) requires equal treatment in taxation. In the Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker judgment, the Court held that it was contrary to Article 45 TFEU to deny tax advantages (e.g. married couples and social security allowances) to a man who worked in Germany who lived in Belgium when other Germans received benefits. By contrast, in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg, the Court rejected Weigel\u2019s claim that the re-registration charge on his car brought into Austria infringed his right of free movement. Although the tax had a 'probable negative impact on migrant workers's decision to exercise their right to free movement' since the levy applied equally to Austrians because there was no EU legislation on this issue, it had to be considered justified. Thirdly, people must be treated equally with regard to'social interests', even though the conditions of residence have been approved by the Court of Justice. In his judgment in Hendrix v Workers' Insurance Institution, the Court held that the Dutch national was not entitled to continue invalidity benefits when he moved to Belgium because the benefit was 'closely linked to the Dutch socio-economic situation'. On the other hand, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, the Court held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands who works in Germany between 3 and 14 hours a week is not entitled to German child supplements, even if the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but lived in Austria could have. The general justification for restricting freedom of movement in Article 45(3) TFEU is 'public order, public security or public health', and Article 45(4) also contains a general exception to 'employment in public services'."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What has the Court required to be more accessible?", "id": "5726bcde708984140094cfc2", "answers": [{"text": "higher education", "answer_start": 245}, {"text": "higher education", "answer_start": 245}, {"text": "higher education", "answer_start": 245}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Commission v Austria", "answer_start": 391}], "question": "What case did the Court state that Austria was allowed to hold places in Austrian schools exclusivity for Austrian students?", "id": "5ad158c0645df0001a2d182a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "higher education", "answer_start": 245}], "question": "What has the Court required to be less accessible?", "id": "5ad158c0645df0001a2d182b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The Court of Justice has increasingly regarded EU citizenship as a 'basic status' for nationals of Member States and has therefore increased the number of social services that people can use wherever they move.

In Gebhard v Consiglio dell\u00f3rdine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano, the Court held that \"stability and continuity\" means \"stability and continuity\" in economic life, whereas \"services\" meant \"temporary\" activity. This meant that Mr Stuttgart's lawyer, who had established a Chamber in Milan and had been condemned by the Milan Bar Council for not registering, had the right to claim freedom of establishment or freedom of service. However, requirements which must be registered in Milan before they can carry out their activities shall be allowed if they are not discriminatory, justified by \"overriding requirements of the general interest\" and applied proportionately. Any person or entity engaged in an economic activity, in particular self-employed persons or \"enterprises\", such as undertakings or undertakings, has the right to set up a business without unjustified restrictions. The Court held that both the government of a Member State and the private party could prevent the freedom of establishment, so Article 49 had both a vertical and a horizontal direct effect. In Reyners v Belgium, the Court held that it was unjustified to refuse to include a lawyer in a Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality. Article 49 TFEU states that States are exempt from the infringement of the freedom of establishment of others when they exercise \"official authority\", but this was not the work of a lawyer (as opposed to the work of a court). By contrast, in the Commission v Italy, the Court held that the requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with the maximum tariffs, unless an agreement has been concluded with the customer, is not a restriction. The Grand Chamber of the Court held that the Commission had not demonstrated that this had a purpose or an effect which would restrict the access of professionals to the market.

For example, in Van Binsbergen v. Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid, a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium when he advised a customer in a social security case and was informed that he could not continue because under Dutch law only persons established in the Netherlands could provide legal advice. The Court held that the freedom to provide services was applied and was directly in force and the rule was likely to be unfounded: obtaining an address in a Member State would be sufficient to pursue a legitimate objective of good administration of justice. The Court has held that secondary education does not fall within the scope of Article 56, since it is generally financed by the State even though it is not covered by higher education. Health care is usually a service. Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Geraets-Smits claimed that the Netherlands social security would compensate him for the costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities considered treatment to be unnecessary, so he claimed that this restricted the freedom to provide services (Germany\u2019s health centre). Several governments considered that hospital services should not be regarded as financial services and should not be covered by Article 56. However, the Court considered that health was a \"service\", even though the government (more than the recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could have the right to refuse reimbursement of medical services provided to patients abroad if healthcare received at home were to be provided without undue delay and would follow \"international medicine\" where treatments are considered normal and necessary. The Court insists that individual patient circumstances justify waiting lists, and this also applies to the UK National Health Service. In addition to public services, services classified as illegal are sensitive. Mr Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht considered that the Dutch provision on the consumption of cannabis, including the bans on certain municipalities to go to coffee shops for tourists (but not for Dutch nationals) was completely excluded from Article 56. The Court has ruled that drugs are controlled in all Member States and is therefore different from other cases where prostitution or other seemingly legal activities are restricted. Where Article 56 applies, the restriction may be justified on the basis of Article 52 or of force majeure developed by the Court of Justice. At Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn, a company that sold commodity futures (with Merrill Lynch and other banking companies) attempted to challenge the Dutch law prohibiting cold call customers. The Court held that the Dutch ban had a legitimate objective of preventing 'undesired development in the trading of securities', including the protection of consumers against aggressive sales tactics, which maintained confidence in the Dutch market. Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn Council banned the \"laserdrome business\". It purchased counterfeit laser weapons services from a British company called Pulsar Oy, but the residents had protested against \"killing\" entertainment. The Court held that the constitutional value of Germany's dignity on which the ban was based was considered to be justified as a restriction on the freedom to provide services. In the Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa, the Court also held that the state monopoly on gambling and the punishment for Gibraltar, which had sold online gambling services, were justified in preventing fraud and gambling where people had very different views. The prohibition was proportionate as it was an appropriate and necessary way of addressing serious problems related to fraud on the Internet.

Ktenophores have been compared with spiders in their various techniques of catching catch \u2014 some of them hanging in the water with their tentacles as \"nets\", some of them being ambushed predators, such as the jumping spiders of Saltid, and some hang a sticky drop on a fine thread, as the boos spiders do. This variety explains how many forms of the body are quite few in the species. The two-storey \"Cypriot\" Lampea eats only salpos, close relatives of large chain-like floating colonies, and the young people of Lampea cling like parasites to the salves that are too large to be swallowed. Pleurobrachia and Lobate Bolinopsis often end up in the same place and at the same time in a high population density, because they specialize in different species of prey: Pleurobrachia\u2019s long tentacles capture relatively strong swimmers, such as adult running pedestals, while Bolinopsis usually eats smaller, weaker swimmers, such as rotifers and molluscs and shellfish larvae."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Why was it thought that  ctenophores were a poor diet for other animals?", "id": "57268a37f1498d1400e8e33c", "answers": [{"text": "their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water", "answer_start": 91}, {"text": "their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water", "answer_start": 91}, {"text": "low ratio of organic matter to salt and water", "answer_start": 97}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do beroids typically eat?", "id": "57268a37f1498d1400e8e33e", "answers": [{"text": "ctenophores", "answer_start": 238}, {"text": "other ctenophores", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "other ctenophores", "answer_start": 586}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "20 times as fast", "answer_start": 471}], "question": "How quickly do shrimp digest ctenophores as compared to other prey?", "id": "5a8397d0e60761001a2eb7fd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "good", "answer_start": 535}], "question": "What kind of diet can salmon provide to other predators?", "id": "5a8397d0e60761001a2eb7fe", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Ctenophores used to be considered \"dead\" in marine food chains because it was thought that their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a bad diet for other animals.

Detailed studies of the ghost salmon, Oncorhynchus ketan, showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as shrimps, and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough. Beroids hunt mainly other ctenophores. Some jellyfish and turtles eat large amounts of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenofor populations. Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in populations, most fish preying on them are general practitioners and may have a greater impact on populations than specialised jelly eaters.

Mnemiopsis is well equipped to conquer new areas (although this was predicted only after it successfully inhabited the Black Sea) because it can multiply very quickly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinity. The effect was increased by continuous overfishing and eutrophication, which boosted the entire ecosystem in the short term, causing the Mnemiopsis population to grow even faster than normal \u2013 and, above all, by the lack of new ctenophores for effective predators. The Mnemiopsis populations from these regions were finally controlled by the accidental introduction of the North American Ctenophore Beroe ovary and by cooling the local climate between 1991 and 1993, which significantly slowed the animal\u2019s metabolism.

Several more recent studies comparing a complete sequence of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as a sister generation for all other animals. This position indicates that the types of nerve and muscle cells either disappeared in large animal lines (e.g. Porifera) or developed independently in the ctenofore line. Other researchers have argued, however, that placing Ctenophora as a sister in all other animals is a statistical anomaly due to the rapid development of ctenophoric genome, and that Porifera (spongee) is, on the other hand, an early animal clot.

Instead, he found that different families of cydippies were more like members of other ctenofor regulations than other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of current ctenophores should be either cydippid or beroid-type. A 2001 molecular phylogen analysis using 26 species, including four species recently discovered, confirmed that cydippids are not monophyletic and noted that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was similar to cydippid. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small \u2014 so small that the relationship between Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively fresh, and was perhaps lucky to survive the Cretaceous Paleogene extinction 65.5 million years ago when other families were destroyed.

The park has a multipurpose amphitheater that can accommodate up to 2,500 people, a genuine Japanese garden, a fenced dog park, three kilometres of riding route, a training par course, three children's playgrounds, a lake, three small ponds, seven picnic areas and eight kilometres of multipurpose trails, which are part of the Lewis S. Eaton Trail route of San Joaquin River Parkway. When the Lewis S. Eaton route system is complete, it will cover 35 kilometers between Highway 99 and Friant Dam. The numerous picnic tables in the park allow a fantastic picnic destination and a convenient escape from the city's life.

But the X.25 will do it on the network layer of the OSI model. Frame Relay does it on level two, the data link layer. Another important difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the parties responsible for communication before sending the user packages. Frame Relay doesn't define handshakes like this. X.25 does not specify any functions in the package network. It only works on the user-network interface (UNI). Therefore, the network provider is free to use any method he wishes to use within the network. X.25 defines some limited retransmission procedures within the UNI and its LAPB protocol (link layer protocol) provides standard HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's dual-layer protocol, LAPD and LAPB. Therefore, its integrity functions only concern the link between nodes, not between them. All retransmissions shall be carried out by means of a higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol series consisting of three lower layers of the OSI model. It was widely used in the UNI in parcel exchange networks in the early 1980s and 1990s in order to establish a standardised interface with and beyond the parcel networks. Some of the projects also used X.25 within the network, but its associated features made the installation difficult and ineffective. Frame-rele works mainly on the second floor of the OSI model. However, the Data Link Connection ID (DLCI) may be used in the OSI network layer using minimum methods. Thus, it is rid of many X.25 layers with 3 layers, but DLCI is still an identifier that crosses the node-to-node-level two-link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Since Frame relay is a data link layer protocol such as X.25, it does not define intra-net routing functions. For X.25, its package identifiers \u2013 the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers must be correlated to the URLs. The same applies to Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done depends on the network provider. Frame Relay, as no network layer procedures exist, is connected to layer two, using HDLC/LAPD/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). An X.25 connection is typically created for each communication session, but it has a feature that allows a limited amount of traffic through the UNI without any connection-oriented handshake. For some time Frame Relay was used to connect LAN networks between large-scale networks. However, X.25 and Frame Relay have been replaced by Internet Protocol (IP) on the network layer and by Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or multi-proximity ID switch (MPLS) versions on the second layer. Typical configuration is running an IP over an ATM or an MPLS version. <Uyless Black, X.25 and related protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991 > <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw-Hill, 1998 <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> < Uyless Black, ATM, Part 1, Prentice Hall, 1995 >"}, {"qas": [{"question": "WHen did ARPNET and SITA become operational", "id": "57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7b", "answers": [{"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}, {"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}, {"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "X.25 uses what type network type ", "id": "57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7e", "answers": [{"text": "User Datagram Protocol", "answer_start": 383}, {"text": "the datagram model", "answer_start": 619}, {"text": "UDP", "answer_start": 407}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "about twenty", "answer_start": 90}], "question": "How many different network technologies where there before 1973?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "host interface", "answer_start": 575}], "question": "X.25 had a simpler what?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the datagram model", "answer_start": 619}], "question": "X.25 had less functionality because of what?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "ARPANET and SITA HLN became operational in 1969.

In 1898, Paul-Louis Simond confirmed the mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually seized and was accompanied by flea bites that had clogged the mid-body by repeating Y. pestis several days after eating from the infected host. This blockage causes flea famine and aggressive eating behavior, which repeatedly tries to remove their blockage by vomiting, which washes thousands of plague bacteria into the feeding site and infects the host. The abscess mechanism was also dependent on two rodent populations: one that is resistant to the disease, which acts as host, considers the disease to be endemic and the other that lacks resistance.

Since rock units other than mud do not significantly change the volume, this is done primarily in two ways: faulting and folding. In a shallow shell, where there may be a fragile deformation, there are protruding defects that cause a deeper rock to move on a lower rock. Since the deeper stone is often older, as the principle of superposition has stated, it can lead to older stones being passed on to younger ones. Moving along faults can lead to folding, either because the defects are not classy or because the rock layers are drawn forward, giving the defect to stretchy folds. On a deeper earth, stones behave in plastic form and fold instead of faults. These folds may either be those where the material in the centre of the foldable buckles creates \"antibodies\" or where it closes downwards, creating \"synforms\". If the tops of the rock units inside the folds remain upward, they are called anticlinics and synchronized. If some of the units in the fold are downwards, the structure is called reverse anti-clinical or synchronized, and if all the rock units fall or the correct upward direction is not known, they are simply called by the most common terms, anti-forms and synforms."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Stretched rocks that pinch into lenses are known by what word?

Continuous movement along with the fault maintains topographical inclination despite sediment movements and continues to create storage space for the material. Deformative events are often also related to volcanoes and aggressive activities. Volcanic ash and lava accumulate on the surface, and intrusive intrusive intrusives come under the surface.

Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulkasis) (936-1013) was a pioneer in the manufacture of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is particularly interesting because it provides a reader with recipes and explains how to prepare \"simplifications\", which were combined with then commonly used complex drugs. However, Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869) was the first doctor to start a pharmacopoeia describing a wide range of medicines and treatments for pain. Al-Biruni (973-1050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works in pharmacology, called Kitab al-Saydalah (Book on Drugs), in which he described in detail the properties of medicines and presented the role of the pharmacy and the tasks and duties of the pharmacy. Avicenna also described 700 medicinal products, their properties, procedures and indications. In fact, he devoted an entire amount to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. In addition, Baghdad and Cairo al-Maridin and Ibn al-Wafid (1008-1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appeared as De Medicinis universalbus et specificus as a younger Mesue and Medicamentis simplecibus 'Abenguefit'.

Such unequal treatment may be due to fear of the transfer of power to ethnic Chinese under their control. Mongols and Semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty, and it would last even after the imperial experiment had been restored in the early 13th century.

Other bacteria produce surface proteins that bind to and render antibodies ineffective, such as Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A) and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L)."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the process by which the adaptive immune system is evaded by the chainging of non-essential epitopes called?", "id": "572a0e4b6aef051400155214", "answers": [{"text": "antigenic variation", "answer_start": 256}, {"text": "antigenic variation", "answer_start": 256}, {"text": "antigenic variation", "answer_start": 256}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is an example of a virus that uses antigenic variation?", "id": "572a0e4b6aef051400155215", "answers": [{"text": "HIV", "answer_start": 291}, {"text": "HIV", "answer_start": 291}, {"text": "HIV", "answer_start": 291}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is an example of a parasite that used the antigenic variation strategy to evade destruction?", "id": "572a0e4b6aef051400155216", "answers": [{"text": "Trypanosoma brucei", "answer_start": 539}, {"text": "Trypanosoma brucei", "answer_start": 539}, {"text": "Trypanosoma brucei", "answer_start": 539}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What compounds can be masked with the molecules of the host cell in order for a virus to evade detection?", "id": "572a0e4b6aef051400155217", "answers": [{"text": "antigens", "answer_start": 457}, {"text": "antigens", "answer_start": 457}, {"text": "antigens", "answer_start": 457}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "HIV", "answer_start": 291}], "question": "What is a pathogen that does not use antigenic variation?", "id": "5ad4f8255b96ef001a10a810", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Trypanosoma brucei", "answer_start": 539}], "question": "What is a parasite that always uses the same surface protein?", "id": "5ad4f8255b96ef001a10a812", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The mechanisms used to avoid an adaptive immune system are more complex. The simplest way is to quickly change the non-essential epitope on the surface of the pathogen (amino acids and/or sugars) while keeping the necessary epitopes hidden. This is called antigenic variation. An example is HIV, which is rapidly transformed, so the proteins in its virus shell that are necessary to get into its host cell are constantly changing. These repeated changes in antigens may explain the failure of vaccines directed at this virus. The parasite Trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy, constantly changing the surface protein type to another, allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response. Covering antigens with host molecules is another common strategy to avoid the detection of the immune system. In HIV, the envelope that covers the virus consists of the outer membrane of the host cell; such \"self-covering\" viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them as \"non-self-contained\" structures."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the virus in humans that causes cervical cancer?", "id": "572a0f073f37b31900478680", "answers": [{"text": "human papillomavirus", "answer_start": 445}, {"text": "human papillomavirus", "answer_start": 445}, {"text": "human papillomavirus", "answer_start": 445}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are cancerous tumors of the skin known as?", "id": "572a0f073f37b31900478682", "answers": [{"text": "melanomas", "answer_start": 759}, {"text": "melanomas", "answer_start": 759}, {"text": "melanomas", "answer_start": 759}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are the skin cells that can be transformed into tumors known as?", "id": "572a0f073f37b31900478683", "answers": [{"text": "melanocytes", "answer_start": 741}, {"text": "melanocytes", "answer_start": 741}, {"text": "melanocytes", "answer_start": 741}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "antigens", "answer_start": 161}], "question": "What do tumors express that are also found on normal cells?", "id": "5ad4e4425b96ef001a10a573", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Another important role in the immune system is the identification and removal of tumours.

Imperialism and colonialism have been used to describe man\u2019s superiority, supremacy and influence on man or group of people. Robert Young writes that, although imperialism works from the centre, it is a state policy and is being developed for ideological and economic reasons, colonialism is only a development of colonial and commercial intentions. Colonialism in modern use also tends to imply a certain geographical difference between the colony and the imperial power. In particular, Edward Said distinguishes between imperialism and colonialism by saying that 'imperialism involves 'truth, theory and attitudes that dominate the metropolitan centre that dominates a remote area', while colonialism refers to 'the planting of settlements in a distant area'. The adjacent empires, such as Russia or the Ottoman, are usually excluded from colonial discussions.:116 It can therefore be said that imperialism contains some kind of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically mean imperialism because it lacks political attention.[An additional explanation is needed]"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Political advantage is an attribute of which state policies?", "id": "573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54c", "answers": [{"text": "Imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 232}], "question": "Political disadvantage is an attribute of which state policies?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "characteristics", "answer_start": 1362}], "question": " what do conquering people take away from native populations?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Imperialism and colonialism dictate both political and economic interests over the country and the indigenous people they control, but it is sometimes difficult for researchers to illustrate the difference between the two. Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the repression of one another, if colonialism suggests that the country takes control of the other physically, imperialism refers to political and monetary power either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be an architect who decides how to begin to control the territories, and then imperialism can be seen as creating an idea behind colonial co-operation. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins to conquer the territory and is finally able to control the territories ruled by the previous nation. The central meaning of colonial power is to exploit the valuable property and supplies of the conquered nation and to make the conquering nation benefit from the spoils of war. The purpose of imperialism is to create an empire by conquering the countries of another country and thereby increasing its own power. Colonial power is the builder and preserver of colonial property in the territory of the population coming from a foreign region. Colonism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economy of the region.

Soon, supporters of imperialism, such as Joseph Chamberlain, caught it. To some, imperialism showed politics of idealism and goodwill, to others political selfishness, and more and more linked it to capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic mindset to the term. Lenin, in particular, had a significant influence on the later Marxist imperialist concepts of Imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism. Lenin described imperialism in his article as a natural extension of capitalism, which arose from the need for capitalist economies to continuously expand investment, material resources and labour in a way that required the expansion of the colonial region. Later Marxist theorists echo this notion of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism. Many theorists on the left have followed the structural or systemic nature of imperialism. Such writers have extended the term-related era so that it does not now mean politics or a short space of decades at the end of the 19th century, but a world system that extends centuries away and often returns to Christopher Columbus and, in some cases, to the Crusades. Once the use of the term has expanded, its significance has shifted to five distinct but often parallel axes: morality, economy, system, culture and time. These changes reflect, among other things, changes in sensuality, growing unrest, even clammy, accompanied by a fact of power, especially of Western power."}, {"qas": [{"question": "some debate that there is a correlation between capitalism, imperialism, and what?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c600", "answers": [{"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 91}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 91}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 91}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 91}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 91}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the military-political complex reflected upon within the scope of understanding imperialism?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c602", "answers": [{"text": "the 1950s", "answer_start": 598}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 602}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 602}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 602}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 602}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Hobson argued that imperialism was an international what?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c603", "answers": [{"text": "disease", "answer_start": 687}, {"text": "disease", "answer_start": 687}, {"text": "disease", "answer_start": 687}, {"text": "disease", "answer_start": 687}, {"text": "disease", "answer_start": 687}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 91}], "question": "There is some debate that there is a not correlation between capitalism, imperialism, and what?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d8e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 602}], "question": " When was the military-political complex reflected upon not within the scope of understanding imperialism?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d90", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "disease", "answer_start": 687}], "question": " Hobson argued that imperialism wasn't an international what?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d91", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "taxation", "answer_start": 791}], "question": " How did Hobson argue to not rid the world of imperialism?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d92", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Historians and political theorists have long discussed the correlation between capitalism, aristocracy and imperialism.

When indigenous peoples were treated during the expansion of the Western world, the United States took on a form of imperial power before trying to achieve external imperialism.

The German invasion of 1939, the massacre of the Jewish population and the deportations to concentration camps led to the Warsaw ghetto rebellion in 1943 and to the great and devastating Warsaw rebellion in August-October 1944.

In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three basic forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermium) that interact by exchanging virtual particles called meter bosons. This standard model of particle physics posited the similarity of forces and led scientists to predict the integration of weak and electromagnetic forces into electroweakness theory, which has since been confirmed by observation. The perfect design of the standard model predicts an undetected Higgs mechanism, but neutrino-oscillations, for example, show that the standard model is incomplete. A great unified theory that enables electrical weakness to interact with strong force is considered possible when candidates theories, such as supersymmetrics, are proposed in order to take into account some of the unsolvable problems of physics.
